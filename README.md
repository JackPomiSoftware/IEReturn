IE Return is a small program that allows you to re-enable and launch the Internet Explorer in Windows 11 and Windows 10, where Microsoft tried it's best to hide the old browser from everyone. [Watch preview video.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pk-EogxWWVg)

## Windows 11

- **Disable Redirects** — disables BHO (short for Browser Helper Object DLL module) in the registry, which is used for redirecting IE to Edge.
- **Open IE** — runs VBScript and opens IE with it.
- **Open Edge** — opens Edge.

## Windows 10
- **Enable** — enables IE by disabling BHO in the registry.
- **Disable** — enables BHO and thus makes IE automatically redirect to Edge as usual.
- **Open IE** — opens IE.
- **Open Edge** — opens Edge.
